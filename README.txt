# Description
This is a simple application that plays like the traditional children's game "hangman". I built this to primarily help children and teens learn about the fundamentals of programming.

# Usage
You may use this project however you see fit.

# How to start
Make sure you have python installed or use an IDE. Run the program.

# How it works
The game will check if what the user entered is a letter or word. When the player enters a word, the game will deduct points for each letter which is wrong. Otherwise, the game will just check if the letter that the player entered is in the word.
