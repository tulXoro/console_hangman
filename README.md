# Description
This is a simple application that plays like the traditional children's game [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)). I built this to primarily help children and teens learn about the fundamentals of programming.

# Usage
You may use this project however you see fit.

# How to start
Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, and optionally use an IDE. Clone the repository and run the game with `python3 main.py`.

# How to use
Type the letters or words to guess the displayed word.

# How it works
The game will check if what the user entered is a letter or word. When the player enters a word, the game will deduct points for each letter which is wrong. Otherwise, the game will just check if the letter that the player entered is in the word.
